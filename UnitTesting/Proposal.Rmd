## Introduction

Shallow boundary layer clouds cover vast amounts of subtropical oceans and have an overall cooling effect on the climate (@hartmann1992effect) and are thus important topics of research. In this project shallow boundary layer clouds and stratocumulus clouds will be used interchangeably. These clouds have favored development in particular on the eastern side of subtropical oceans. These clouds are also described as "semipermanent" (@wood2012stratocumulus) because they exist for large periods of time. 

The stratocumulus cloud sheet over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean experiences what have been called "cloud clearing events" which feature large, sharp propogating boundaries which cause irreversible clearing of the low cloud (see \autoref{fig:clearing}). These events are important to understand the effect they have on the Earth's energy balance and the dynamics and feedbacks of the cloud in general. They have been largely unstudied to date. My master's thesis project will focus on simulating these events with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. For this class project a simple case study will be conducted to look at the environmental conditions associated with a clearing event (\autoref{fig:clearing}). These conditions will be compared to another case without a cloud clearing event (\autoref{fig:noclearing}). The ultimate goal of this project will be to see if the test cases match what we expect of the environmental conditions as discussed in @haderthesis.

## Methods
In order to study the environmental conditions of these test cases, several funtions and scripts have been written. The first script used downloads European Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecats (ECMWF). This script utilizes API packages created by the ECMWF (documentation for the WebAPI found [here](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/WEBAPI/ECMWF+Web+API+Home)). The data is presented on pressure surfaces. The variables requested include geopotential (z), temperature (t), vertical velocity (w), relative humidity (r), cloud liquid water content (lwc), cloud cover (cc), horizontal velocity (u,v). The data is requested at the following pressure levels (hPa): 300, 500, 600, 700, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000. Once the selected data is downloaded, a function has been written to select a certain variable at a certain time and level from the downloaded file. After this, another function has been/will be written to plot the data (this step is still a work in progress). 

## Preliminary Results

The results presented in this proposal are very minimal as plotting has not been successful (yet). The following are preliminary results which show the data downloaded and a printout of relative humidity as the first time (25 May 2014 00Z) at the lowest level (1000 hPa)

```{python get_data_clearing}
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "C:\\Users\\Laura\\Documents\\EVRN720\\tomkins_dcei\\UnitTesting\\")
startdate = '2014-05-25'
enddate = '2014-05-27'
date_str = startdate+'/to/'+enddate
data_path = 'interim_'+startdate+'to'+enddate+'.nc'

execfile('ei_download.py')

dir_path = "C:\\Users\\Laura\\Documents\\EVRN720\\tomkins_dcei\\UnitTesting\\"
filename = "interim_"+startdate+"to"+enddate+".nc"
full_path = dir_path+filename

import get_variable as gv
r = gv.get_variable(full_path, "r")

print r[0,8,:,:]

```
